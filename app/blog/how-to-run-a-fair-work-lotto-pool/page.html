      <p className="mb-4">
        Running a work lotto pool can be fun — but only if it's fair, transparent, and organized. 
        Whether it’s Powerball, Mega Millions, or Fantasy 5, the goal is simple: everyone pays 
        equally, everyone is included, and everyone receives the same chance at the winnings. 
        Here's how to run a fair and drama-free lotto pool at your workplace.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Appoint a Trustworthy Pool Manager</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Every pool needs one person in charge of collecting money and buying tickets. This should 
        be someone reliable who keeps clear records and shares photos of the tickets before the drawing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Clearly Set the Rules Before Anyone Pays</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To avoid conflicts later, set rules for payment amounts, deadlines, the game played, and what 
        happens if someone is late or misses a draw.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Keep Payments Transparent</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Keep a visible checklist of who has paid and when. Transparency builds trust.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Share Ticket Images Before the Drawing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Always take clear photos of the group tickets and share them before the drawing. This is the 
        biggest trust factor in any pool.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Don’t Mix Personal Tickets With Pool Tickets</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Always separate personal tickets from pool tickets with separate transactions and receipts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Automatically Share Results</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        After the drawing, share the winning numbers and any winnings — consistency builds trust.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Use a Dedicated Platform</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Using a platform like OnlineLottoPool keeps everything clean: payments, participants, 
        ticket uploads, countdowns, and notifications.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Be Fair. Be Transparent. Have Fun.</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Lotto pools should bring coworkers together, not create arguments. Keep everything simple, 
        fair, and transparent — and enjoy the excitement as a team.
