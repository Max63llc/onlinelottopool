        How to Run a Fair Work Lotto Pool
      </h1>
      <p class="text-secondary-gray mb-6">
        Work lottery pools can be a fun way for coworkers to team up and dream big together —
        as long as everyone understands the rules and everything is handled fairly.
        Here’s a simple guide you can follow (and share with your team) to keep things clear.

          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">1. Pick a Clear Organizer</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Choose one person to act as the <strong>pool organizer</strong>. This person is responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Setting the rules and sharing them with everyone.</li>
            <li>Collecting money from participants.</li>
            <li>Buying the tickets on time.</li>
            <li>Uploading or sharing pictures of the tickets before the draw.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            If you use a site like <strong>Online Lotto Pool</strong>, the organizer can also manage the
            participant list, mark who’s paid, and upload ticket photos in one place.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">2. Write Down the Rules</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Don’t rely on memory or casual talks. Put your rules in writing where everyone can see them.
            At minimum, include:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Which game(s) you’re playing (Powerball, Mega Millions, etc.).</li>
            <li>The draw date(s) covered by each pool.</li>
            <li>How much each person pays per share.</li>
            <li>When money is due (cutoff time).</li>
            <li>What happens with small prizes vs. big jackpots.</li>
            <li>Who is included in the pool (names clearly listed).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            A written rule sheet or a dedicated pool page online avoids drama later.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">3. Use a Clear Payment System</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Decide exactly <strong>how people pay</strong> and how you’ll confirm it. Some groups use:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Cash, collected in advance.</li>
            <li>Payment apps (Cash App, PayPal, etc.), logged by the organizer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            Whatever method you use, make sure participants know they’re only in the pool
            once they’re marked as <strong>PAID</strong> on the list.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">
            (Always follow your local laws and workplace policies when collecting money.)
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">4. Share the Ticket Photos</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            This is one of the most important trust steps. Before the draw:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Buy the tickets.</li>
            <li>Take clear photos of each ticket (front, numbers, date).</li>
            <li>Share the photos with everyone in the pool.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            If your pool uses an online platform, the organizer can simply upload the photos once
            and have them emailed or displayed to all participants.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">5. Decide How You’ll Split Winnings</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Before tickets are bought, everyone should know:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Are prizes split <strong>equally per person</strong> or <strong>per share</strong>?</li>
            <li>Will small prizes be paid out or rolled into future pools?</li>
            <li>Who will physically claim the prize if it’s big?</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            Put this in writing so there’s no confusion if you actually hit a big win.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">6. Keep a History of Pools</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Keeping a simple history helps everyone feel confident:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Dates of each pool.</li>
            <li>Who participated.</li>
            <li>Ticket photos.</li>
            <li>Any prizes won and how they were handled.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            Over time, this also shows your group how often you’ve played and how much you’ve
            put toward tickets.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">7. Respect Workplace Rules</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            Some workplaces have specific rules about gambling, pools, or collecting money on site.
            Make sure your pool:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-secondary-gray mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Doesn’t pressure anyone to join.</li>
            <li>Stays friendly and optional.</li>
            <li>Doesn’t interfere with work.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray">
            A work lotto pool should be fun, not stressful. With clear rules, written
            expectations, and a transparent way to track payments and ticket photos, you can
            keep everything fair for everyone involved.
          </p>
          <p class="text-secondary-gray mt-2">
            If you’re the organizer, tools like <strong>Online Lotto Pool</strong> can help you
            manage members, passwords, and cut-off times in one place — so you can focus on
            the fun part: watching the numbers draw.
